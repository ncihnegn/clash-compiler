Clash internals
===============

Occasionally, brave souls must venture into the ancestral homeland of Clash in
order to understand its inner workings, and its true nature. The location of
this homeland is unchanging but cannot be mentioned here, and is only known to
be connected in a spooky, mystical way to `homeland of GHC
<https://git.haskell.org/ghc.git>`_.

This page is kept by a dedicated scribe who catalogs these adventures, so that
others may learn.
